# Releasing Magpie

A release is a pushed `v*` tag. `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds that tag with `scripts/build-release.sh`: Developer ID signing, notarization with an App Store Connect API key, the Sparkle-signed zip (what updates install), a notarized DMG (what people download), and `appcast.xml`. It publishes all three as a GitHub release on `limboy/magpie`. Installed copies find updates through `releases/latest/download/appcast.xml`, so **the newest release is what every user's Sparkle sees**.

Publishing is outward-facing and can't be quietly undone once users have updated. Confirm the version and notes with the user before pushing anything.

## 1. Check the starting point

```bash
git status --short && git branch --show-current
git fetch --tags -q && git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -5
grep MARKETING_VERSION project.yml
gh secret list -R limboy/magpie
```

- The tree must be clean and on `main`; `scripts/release.sh` refuses otherwise. Don't commit or stash the user's work on your own; ask.
- The secrets should be `CSC_LINK`, `APPLE_API_KEY`, `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`, `APPLE_API_ISSUER` and `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY` (`CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` only if the `.p12` has a password; the current one doesn't).
- The Developer ID certificate expires **Feb 1, 2027**. Near or past that, stop and tell the user to renew it and update `CSC_LINK`.

## 2. Pick the version

The last tag is the last release (with no tags, this is the first release; suggest the version in `project.yml`, `0.1.0`). Suggest the next one from what changed: patch for fixes, minor for features. Let the user decide. The build number is the commit count on `main` and is set automatically; Sparkle compares it, so never release from another branch.

## 3. Draft the notes

```bash
last=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null); git log --no-merges --format='%h %s' ${last:+$last..}HEAD
```

Turn the commits into a short list for listeners, not developers. Each line becomes a bullet in Sparkle's "new version available" window and on the GitHub release:

- One `- ` line per user-visible change, in plain words ("Lyrics show only in the full player", not "Remove inspector").
- Leave out refactors, build and CI changes, and `Release v…` commits.

Write the notes to a file in your scratchpad. Then confirm the version and the notes together with an AskUserQuestion popup, not a question in text: the recommended version first, with the notes as its preview, an alternative version if one is plausible, and "Don't release yet".

## 4. Release

```bash
scripts/release.sh <version> <notes.md>
```

This sets `MARKETING_VERSION`, regenerates the Xcode project, commits `Release v<version>` (unless that's already the version), makes an annotated tag with the notes as its message (the workflow reads them from there), and pushes `main` and the tag.

`LOCAL=1` builds and publishes from this Mac instead. Use it only if the user asks or the workflow can't run. For signing and notarizing locally, the credentials are in `~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Secure/apple_no_certifications_password/` (`DEVELOPER_ID="Developer ID Application: LI ZHONG (5P9ZHW7578)"`, `APPLE_API_KEY_PATH`, `APPLE_API_KEY_ID=C9X9XHN78Y`, `APPLE_API_ISSUER` from `ASC_ISSUER_ID.txt`). Never print or `cat` those files.

## 5. Watch the workflow

```bash
gh run list -R limboy/magpie --workflow release.yml -L 1
gh run watch <run-id> -R limboy/magpie --exit-status
```

Notarization usually takes a few minutes. If a run fails:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> -R limboy/magpie --log-failed | tail -60
```

- **Select Xcode / build errors about the SDK.** The runner's newest Xcode is too old for the project. Check `runs-on` against GitHub's current macOS images.
- **Import signing certificate.** `CSC_LINK` is wrong or expired, or the `.p12` gained a password (set `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`).
- **Notarization `Invalid`.** Fetch the log with `xcrun notarytool log <submission-id>` (with the API key), fix the signing, and release again.
- **Transient (network, notary timeout).** `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`.

If the build can't be fixed under the same tag and nothing was published, delete the tag (`git push origin :refs/tags/v<version>` and `git tag -d v<version>`) after telling the user, fix the problem, and release again. Keep the `Release v…` commit; the next release bumps from there. Never delete or replace a release that's already published: users may have it. Ship a newer version instead.

## 6. Verify what users get

```bash
gh release view v<version> -R limboy/magpie --json assets --jq '.assets[].name'
curl -sL https://github.com/limboy/magpie/releases/latest/download/appcast.xml | grep -E 'shortVersionString|<sparkle:version>|enclosure'
```

The release needs `Magpie-<version>.dmg`, `Magpie-<version>.zip` and `appcast.xml`, and the latest appcast must name this version and link to this release's zip.

Then check the download as a user would see it, in your scratchpad:

```bash
gh release download v<version> -R limboy/magpie -p 'Magpie-*.zip' -D <scratch>
ditto -x -k <scratch>/Magpie-<version>.zip <scratch>/app
xattr -w com.apple.quarantine "0081;$(printf %x $(date +%s));Safari;" <scratch>/app/Magpie.app
spctl -a -t exec -vv <scratch>/app/Magpie.app   # expect: source=Notarized Developer ID
xcrun stapler validate <scratch>/app/Magpie.app

gh release download v<version> -R limboy/magpie -p 'Magpie-*.dmg' -D <scratch>
xattr -w com.apple.quarantine "0081;$(printf %x $(date +%s));Safari;" <scratch>/Magpie-<version>.dmg
spctl -a -t open --context context:primary-signature -vv <scratch>/Magpie-<version>.dmg   # expect: source=Notarized Developer ID
xcrun stapler validate <scratch>/Magpie-<version>.dmg
hdiutil attach -nobrowse -readonly -mountpoint <scratch>/mnt <scratch>/Magpie-<version>.dmg
ls <scratch>/mnt   # expect: Applications  Magpie.app
hdiutil detach <scratch>/mnt
```

Don't launch it, and don't install it over the user's own Magpie. To try the update itself, use a dev-bundle build (`com.limboy.magpie.dev`) as in `scripts/build-release.sh`'s testing variables, never the user's installed app or its data.

## 7. Report

Tell the user the version and build number, the release URL, what the workflow and the checks showed, and anything that failed or was skipped.
